### Hierarchical Consensus
To run the exampleHB script, you need to install the [HierarchicalConsensus](https://github.com/LJeub/HierarchicalConsensus/tree/master) MATLAB toolbox.

**Instructions:**
1. Clone or download the repository from: [https://github.com/LJeub/HierarchicalConsensus/tree/master](https://github.com/LJeub/HierarchicalConsensus/tree/master)
2. Add the folder (including all subfolders) to your MATLAB path:
    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('/path/to/HierarchicalConsensus'))
    ```
3. Make sure all required dependencies from the toolbox are available before running the example script.
